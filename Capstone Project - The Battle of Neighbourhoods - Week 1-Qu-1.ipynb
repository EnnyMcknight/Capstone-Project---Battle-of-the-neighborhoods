    "Anyone that works in the restaurant, service, and hospitality industry knows that it’s not a “get rich quick” type of career. It takes time, hard work, and dedication to be successful.  Even still, a study by Ohio State University reveals that nearly 60% of restaurants close or change ownership within the first year and 80% fail within the first 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve great success in establishing a new restaurant, it depends on several factors: demand, brand loyalty, quality of food, competition, and so on. In most cases, a restaurant’s location plays an essential determinant for its success. Hence, it is advantageous and of utmost importance to determine the most strategic location for establishment in order to maximize business profits.\n"
